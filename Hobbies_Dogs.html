Dance is my true passion, and I find joy in expressing myself through movement and exploring new techniques. I am also a passionate sports enthusiast, and I regularly play cricket and volleyball with friends and family.<br><br>

						In addition to physical activities, I am always eager to help others, and I frequently take on tutoring sessions to assist my mother. I find fulfillment in seeing the progress of my students and knowing that I am making a positive impact on their lives. <br><br>
						
						When I want to unwind and clear my mind, I take long walks to the beach. The sound of waves crashing on the shore, the fresh sea breeze, and the wide expanse of the ocean are a soothing balm for my soul. These activities keep me grounded and inspired, and I look forward to continuing to pursue them in the future.</p> -->

										With her gentle and affectionate nature, she is a favorite among many. Her behavior is impeccable, which
										may be attributed to the fact that her mother is from London. Snoophy is not just a pet, but a cherished
